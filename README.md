#Inspiration

There are too many dues for CMU students! Different courses require different Handin platforms!! I cannot remember them!!!!! I'm so confused!

#What it does

Basically, Due Reminder, an iOS app, will let students log in via their AndrewID and let them add different courses. So they can see their courses, due dates, due homework and hand in method on the app. Instructors can also use the app to post dues and enroll students.

#How we built it

Due Reminder has two parts: a server built in Python that is used to store users' data and a front end iOS app that interacts with the users.

#Challenges we ran into

This is our first time to build a Python based server and an iOS app. We encountered a lot of problems using Swift: such as the confusing NSURLSession to connect the server and the graphic UI that sometimes mess everything up. As a sophomore, this is also the first time my friend (also a sophomore) and I work with and teach freshmen coders.

#Accomplishments that we're proud of

A functional server and front end app!! We made it!

#What we learned

Communication between Python-based server and iOS app

#What's next for Due Reminder

We'll keep developing this project to add in more features and more beautiful UI. Our goal is to distribute it among CMU students and students from other colleges.
